        "Channeling the old-world techniques of our Grandma Grace and her unwavering ability to produce hand-crafted cookies consistently both delicious and ornate, her much beloved amaretti cookie recipe will take you to straight into the doors of the authentic bakeries of Lipari, Italy and their intoxicating aromas. Created carefully with the same love, attention and high-quality, real ingredients we know our nonna would only approve of, our fresh amaretto cookie dough is hand-dipped with care in crystallized sugar and adorned with a whole almond just before it’s placed into our oven to gently bake to perfection. The final result is a rich, bold, dense cookie adored by the whole famiglia.",
